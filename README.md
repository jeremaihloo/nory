# Ncms

Ncms is an open-source modular and extensible application framework built with python3 async/await, and a content management system (CMS) built on top of that application framework.

## Build Status

Stable (master):

Nightly (dev):

## Status

### Pre-Alpha

The software is still under active development and not feature complete or ready for consumption by anyone other than software developers. There may be milestones during the pre-alpha which deliver specific sets of functionality, and nightly builds for other developers or users who are comfortable living on the absolute bleeding edge.

### Goals

Validate all the core components of Ncms work together to enable module development. We should be able to setup an Ncms site and run a blog engine with a minimal set of custom modules.
